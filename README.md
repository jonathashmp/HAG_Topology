# Hybrid-Active-Gripper-A-Novel-Topology-for-Object-Grasping

This study presents a novel topology of a robotic gripper with three reconfigurable fingers. Each finger can move 180ยบ around the object and adjust its lateral inclination by up to 10ยบ to obtain the best configuration to pick up an object. The gripper has two models designed and printed on a 3D printer using plastic polymer (PLA) material. These models have 12 degrees of freedom (DoF) each, the main difference between them being the finger closure, as the Hybrid-Active (H-A) gripper 1 uses the closure of the distal phalanx through a link with the middle phalanx and the H-A gripper 2 has independent control of each degree of freedom.

Below we have the two versions of the claw with its exploded view. On the left side is the H-A Gripper one that has finger closure control through a link, and on the right side, we have the H-A Gripper two that uses micro servos to control the phalanges.

## Instructions

These instructions explain how H-A grippers work and the parts needed to rebuild the gripper using a 3D printer. 

With this information, you can assemble the grips by downloading the [STL files of the H-A gripper one and two](https://github.com/jonathashmp/HAG_Topology/tree/main/STL%20H-A%20Grippers%201%20and%202).

### 1 - Mechanism of Fingers Closing

The finger close mechanism is responsible for gripping the object and its structure can be seen in figure below. The figure shows two types of fingers: the left finger is from H-A gripper one, and the right finger is from H-A gripper two.
